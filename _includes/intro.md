My work explores the intersection of classical philology and contemporary digital archival practices. Through a lens of philosophical inquiry, I investigate how historical manuscripts inform our modern understanding of identity and memory.

For over a decade, my research has focused on the tactile nature of 19th-century epistolary culture and its digital afterlife. By employing computational linguistics alongside traditional close reading, I aim to uncover the voices lost in the margins of institutional archives.

This portfolio serves as a digital repository of my academic journey—a space where research findings, pedagogical philosophy, and ongoing inquiries coalesce into a living narrative of scholarly exploration.
